title: SegSalad - A Hands On Review of Semantic Segmentation Techniques for Weed/Crop Datasets 
excerpt: >-
  In this project, I explore a few common semantic segmentation techniques that have been used on weed/crop datasets for precision agriculture tasks. I use image patching as a data augmentation technique, train with transfer learning for three different semantic segmentation neural network architectures, and compare these models qualitatively and with the Intersection Over Union metric. I discuss the challenges and takeaways of the project.
