## Abstract
Understanding the relationship between genes and phenotypes is 
fundamental to biology research. However, the resources needed for 
experimentation and the technology used to analyze experiments limit the 
generation of new phenotypic data. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the 
fidelity of generating phenotypic data by performing retroactive image analysis
using a zebrafish microCT data analysis framework as a model. A database of 
zebrafish microCT scans and quantitative phenotypic data from previously analyzed 
gene knockout experiments was compiled for use in batch retroactive analysis. By 
modularizing a zebrafish skeleton microCT image analysis program called FishCuT, 
a framework for easily adding phenotypic detection functionality to this software in 
the form of discrete modules was developed. Improvements of the FishCuT software 
can be implemented not only in future experiments, but also retroactively by 
analyzing the raw microCT data inside the database. This retroactive image analysis 
technique can be used to append the existing phenotypic data records without 
additional experimentation by detecting phenotypes that were undetected in past 
experiment analyses. By creating an open source project, experimental data and 
phenotype detection modules can be collected based on the needs and interests of 
other researchers, and thus phenotypic data could be generated rapidly as 
technology continues to improve and more experiments are conducted. In this 
study, a module for skeletal measurements of the zebrafish neural arch was used as 
a proof of concept for further development of image analysis technology and 
phenotypic data generation using retroactive image analysis, and it was 
retroactively implemented to discover new skeletal phenotypes in the zebrafish 
microCT database. Retroactive image analysis can improve the data yield of 
experiments and lead to more rapid and less resource intensive discoveries.
