title: Geometric Models and Image Analysis Algorithms for Detecting Skeletal Phenotypes in Zebrafish to Identify Osteoporosis Causal Genes 
excerpt: >-
    I developed geometric models and image analysis algorithms for rapidly and automatically detecting skeletal abnormalities from microCT data. By using integral calculus and regression, I developed a predictive model that takes in easily quantifiable bone measurements and outputs the measurement of a structures that we could not measure directly. I implemented this module using R programming. Additionally, I wrote prototypical modules in MATLAB for the measurement of these structures, which were the basis for modules for FishCuTv2. These tools are a much higher throughput method of measuring these bone characteristics compared to the standard of manual measurement. This work earned me my first Mary Gates Research Scholarship.

## Abstract
More than 40 million people in the United States have or are at risk for osteoporosis, a 
condition characterized by traits including low bone mineral density (BMD) and high fracture risk. 
Though genome-wide association studies have identified many candidate genes associated with 
genetic risk factors, genetic variations that are associated with osteoporosis-related traits, the 
causal genes underlying these risk factors remain undiscovered. My research centers around 
developing tools to assess bone morphology in a zebrafish model to identify specific genes that 
cause osteoporosis or other skeletal abnormalities. Because a trademark characteristic of 
osteoporosis is expanded bone diameter due to accelerated bone remodeling and increased 
resorption in the endosteum, I have developed tools to assess bone expansion in zebrafish vertebral 
structures. 

By using integral calculus and basic machine learning with the R programming language, 
I developed a predictive model for calculating approximate diameters for the centrum foramen, 
the hole in the zebrafish vertebral body. As a more direct alternative, I have also developed a 
program using image analysis tools in MATLAB that identifies the foramina of the centra, neural 
(superior) arches, and haemal (inferior) arches in binarized microCT stacks of zebrafish skeletons 
and calculates the cross-sectional area of each foramen. I am using these tools to retroactively 
analyze previously scanned mutant zebrafish to identify genes that have phenotypes consistent 
with abnormal foramina of the vertebral body and arches. 

I have determined that mutants with the bmp1a and plod2 genes knocked out separately 
have expanded centrum foramina. After compiling and analyzing a zebrafish data archive with 
data from other previously imaged mutant samples, my results will indicate previously undetected 
phenotypes. This data will aid in my labâ€™s efforts to determine the causal genes underlying 
osteoporosis genetic risk factors. This research may lead to discoveries that are used in future 
osteoporosis gene therapies
