title: An Extensible Software for Whole-Skeleton microCT Analysis of Zebrafish 
excerpt: >-
    In this porject, I reorganize an existing microCT analysis codebase into a modular 
    architecture that allows for faster and easier development of discrete and specific blocks of code. 
    To demonstrate the utility of this structure, I 
    prototyped an extension for additional measurements on a zebrafish vertebral structure called the 
    neural arch. By implementing this prototyped module retroactively in existing microCT data from 
    a gene-knockout experiment, I have appended the experiment data records with an additional 
    neural arch phenotype for the zebrafish gene bmp1a, which has an analogous gene in humans 
    associated with brittle bone disease.

## Abstract
Zebrafish are an emerging model for skeletal biology in part because they are amenable to 
rapid-throughput approaches for applications including identifying possible causal genes of 
heritable skeletal conditions such as osteoporosis. Previously, a software called FishCuT was 
developed for measuring the vertebrae of the zebrafish in microCT image stacks; though this 
software was not conducive to further development. Expanding FishCuT’s measurement content 
will help researchers characterize the skeletal features of the analyzed fish with more detail to aid 
in basic research which could lead to clinical applications such as identifying new drug targets. 

To expand FishCuT’s capabilities, first I reorganized the codebase into a modular 
architecture that allows for faster and easier development of discrete and specific blocks of code. 
The new architecture allows developers to create extensions to FishCuT without having to 
understand the details of the core software. To demonstrate the utility of this structure, I have 
prototyped an extension for additional measurements on a zebrafish vertebral structure called the 
neural arch. By implementing this prototyped module retroactively in existing microCT data from 
a gene-knockout experiment, I have appended the experiment data records with an additional 
neural arch phenotype for the zebrafish gene bmp1a, which has an analogous gene in humans 
associated with brittle bone disease. 

This development strategy facilitates collaborative work, and we aim to make FishCuT an 
open source project for the zebrafish research community. Expanding FishCuT’s measurements to 
other skeletal structures and features, in conjunction with retroactive microCT analysis, can greatly 
increase the knowledge of the zebrafish community and catalyze discoveries and developments 
for treatments of skeletal conditions
