### Education and Experience
Hello, and thank you for visiting my personal website! I will be graduating with my **M.S. Computer Science** degree in December 2022, so I am **seeking full-time software engineering opportunities**, especially in **Climate Tech and Research**.

I have worked on a breadth of software engineering teams including: **Microsoft Azure AutoML**, **Microsoft Azure WAN Emulation** and **Cisco Webex Platform Services**. I also assist with teaching computer science courses including (**computer vision, machine learning, and C/C++**).

### Technical Interests

I am a young, passionate, and curious software engineer interested in applications of **Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Robotics** for environmental missions including **Climate Research, Reforestation and Wildfire Prevention, and Marine Conservation**.

A few **course topics** that I have really enjoyed and excelled at include: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Robotics, Data Management, Systems Programming (C/C++), and Environmental Ethics.

### Fun Facts
When I am not studying or working, I enjoy being active and outdoors. I especially enjoy surfing, rock climbing, and hiking!
