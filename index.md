### Education and Experience
Hello, and thank you for visiting my personal website! I am currently pursuing my **Master's in Computer Science & Engineering** at the University of Washington (UW). I will be graduating soon in December 2022, so I am **seeking full-time software engineering opportunities**, especially in **Climate Tech**.

I have worked on a breadth of software engineer teams including: **Microsoft Azure AutoML**, **Microsoft Azure WAN Emluation** and **Cisco Webex Platform Services**. I also assist with teaching computer science courses including (**machine learning, computer vision, and C/C++**).

### Technical Interests

I am especially interested in applications of **Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Robotics** for environmental missions including **Environmental Research, Electric Vehicles, Precision Agriculture, Reforestation, Marine Conservation, and Waste Management**.

A few **courses** that I have really enjoyed and excelled at include: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Autonomous Robotcs, Data Management, Systems Programming (C/C++), and Environmental Ethics.
