### Education and Experience
Hello, and thank you for visiting my personal website! I am currently pursuing my **Master's in Computer Science & Engineering** at the University of Washingotn (UW). I graduated from UW with a double major in **Computer Science and Applied & Computational Mathematical Sciences** in Spring 2021.

I have a breadth of software related experiences including: software engineering with **Microsoft Azure and Cisco Webex**, teaching computer science courses (**machine learning, C/C++**), and **research** with the UW Department of Orthopaedics. My hard work has earned me recognition through the CSE Award for Excellence, two Mary Gates Research Scholarships, and the Undergraduate Research Conference Travel Award.

Apart from my technical work, I have had opportunities to work in leadership roles with the UW Undergraduate Research Program and the UW iGEM Undergraduate Research Team.

### Technical Interests

I am especially interested in applications of **Computer Vision and Robotics** in **Electric Vehicles, Precision Agriculture, Reforestation, Marine Conservation, and Waste Management**.

A few **courses** that I have really enjoyed and excelled at include: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Data Management, Systems Programming (C/C++), and Environmental Ethics.


### Fun Facts
When I am not studying or working, I enjoy calisthenics workouts and adventuring outdoors.
