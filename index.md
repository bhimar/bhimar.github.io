### Education and Experience
Hello, and thank you for visiting my personal website! I am a student at the University of Washington (UW) double majoring in **Computer Science and Applied & Computational Mathematical Sciences.** After I graduate in Spring 2021, I will be pursuing my Master's in Computer Science through the **UW CSE Combined B.S./M.S. program**.

I have a breadth of software related experiences including: **software engineering with Cisco, teaching computer science courses (machine learning, C/C++) with the Allen School, and research with the UW Department of Orthopaedics.** My hard work has earned me recognition through the CSE Award for Excellence, two Mary Gates Research Scholarships, and the Undergraduate Research Conference Travel Award.

Apart from my technical work, I have had opportunities to work in leadership roles with the UW Undergraduate Research Program and the UW iGEM Undergraduate Research Team.

### Technical Interests

The technologies that really excite me are Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning Infrastructure, and Cloud Computing. I am especially interested in applications of these technologies in Precision Agriculture, Electric Vehicles, and Robotics.

A few courses that I have really enjoyed and excelled at include: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Systems Programming (C/C++), and Environmental Ethics.


### Fun Facts
When I am not studying or working, I enjoy calisthenics workouts, social dancing (pre-covid), and adventuring outdoors.
